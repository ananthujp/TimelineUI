<h2>Overview</h2>
This repository contains the source code and demo for a dynamic Timeline User Interface built using React.js. The Timeline UI displays a chronological list of events and allows users to explore each event by clicking on it. When an event is clicked, it reveals a detailed description and a photo gallery associated with the event.

<h2>Features</h2>
<h4>Interactive Timeline:</h4> Events are organized chronologically, allowing users to easily navigate through different periods.
<h4>Event Details:</h4> Clicking on an event opens a modal or a dedicated page displaying the event's description and additional information.
<h4>Photo Gallery:</h4> Each event includes a photo gallery, allowing users to view images related to the event.
<h4>Responsive Design:</h4> The UI is designed to be responsive, ensuring a seamless experience across various devices and screen sizes.
<h2>Technologies Used</h2>
<h4>React.js:</h4> The UI components and interactivity are built using React.js, a popular JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
<h4>HTML/CSS:</h4> The structure and styling of the timeline and event details are implemented using HTML and CSS.
<h4>JavaScript:</h4> JavaScript is used for handling interactions, dynamic content loading, and managing event data.
